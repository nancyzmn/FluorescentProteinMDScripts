Example input file for running a constrained QM/MM excited state (S2) NVT calculation using TCPB. 
Level of theory:
QM: FOMO-CASCI (6,10)
MM: Amber

#### FILES REQUIRED ####
mdin_qmmm.prod: input file for AMBER
terachem.inp: input file for TeraChem
coors.rst7: initial geometry
mod.prmtop: parmtop file
initialmin.sh: run script

#### To run the calculation ####
ml purge
ml Amber #You have to load Amber first
ml TeraChem 

nohup terachem -g 5 -s 12340 >nohup_tc.out & #Using gpu 5 and port number 12340 (this number is defined in mdin_qmmm.prod)
nohup sh initialmin.sh >nohup_amber.out & 

#### Output file ####
server_2024-05-27-15.15.50: scratch folder. You could find TC results of every step here.
test.out: amber output file
test.mdcrd: amber output trajectory
Here I only ran two steps of the calculation. You would also have the restart file after the calculation finished.
