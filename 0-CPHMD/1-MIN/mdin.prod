REM for CpH
&cntrl
icnstph=1,      ! the flag to turn on constant pH simulations
ntt=3,          ! Switch for temperature scaling (=3, Use Langevin dynamics with the collision frequency â€“ gamma_ln)
gamma_ln=5.0,   ! Collision frequency in ps-1 (10.0 ps-1)
ntc=2,          ! Flag for SHAKE to perform bond length constraints (=2, bonds involving hydrogen are constrained)
ntf=2,          ! Force evaluation (=2, bond interactions involving H-atoms omitted)
ntb=2,          ! Periodicity is applied i(=2, constant pressure (default when ntp > 0)
ntp=1,          ! Flag for constant pressure dynamics (=1 md with isotropic position scaling)
barostat=2,     ! Flag used to control which barostat to use in order to control the pressure (=1, Berendsen; =2, Monte Carlo)
pres0=1.0,      ! Reference pressure (1 bar)
taup=5.0,       ! Pressure relaxation time (in ps). Recommend values between 1.0 and 5.0 ps
cut=8.0,        ! no cutoff 
dt=0.002,       ! The time step (psec)
nstlim=100,     ! the number of steps between exchange attempts
numexchg=500000,! the number of times to attempt exchanging between replica
solvph=X,       ! solvent pH 
ntcnstph=250,     ! the number of steps between attempting protonation state changes
saltcon=0.1,    ! the salt concentration
ig=2321,        ! The seed for the pseudo-random number generator (=-1, it will be based on the current date and time, and hence will be different for every run)
ntwr=5000000,   ! The "restrt" file will be written every ntwr steps during dynamics
ntwx=1000,      ! The coordinates will be written to the mdcrd file every ntwx steps
ntpr=1000,      ! Energy information will be printed in human-readable form to files "mdout" and "mdinfo" every ntpr steps.
iwrap=1,
ioutfm=1,       ! The format of coordinate and velocity trajectory files (=1, Binary NetCDF trajectory)
igb=0,          ! Use the GB model CpHMD and CEMD were parametrized for
irest=1,        ! Flag to restart a simulation
ntx=5,          ! Option to read the initial coordinates, velocities and box size from the inpcrd file (=5, coord. and veloc.will be read)
